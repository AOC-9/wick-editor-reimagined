  * Or any other kinds of harassment

  Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care. 
* **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. 
* **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

## Reporting
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [contact@wickeditor.com](mailto:contact@wickeditor.com). Please include your username and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the behavior, the Wick Editor team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Wick Editor spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Wick Editor members or the general public.
